# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This project is about Breast Cancer Classification. In this project dataset created by r. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin, USA is used for classification. In the dataset, cancer cells are divided into benign and malign,two groups. After preprocessing and standard scaling along with Label encoding, dataset are classified with various classification models.

## Notebook-1

In this project, after preprocessing the dataset is analyzed with various classification algorithm. They are:

* Logical regression
* K Neighbor Classifier
* SVC
*  SVC with kernel
*  GaussianNB
*  Decision Tree
*  Random Forest Classifier

## Notebook-2

In this project dataset is analyzed with Neural Network

## .py File

Here the dataset is analyzed with SVC (Support vector Classifier).
